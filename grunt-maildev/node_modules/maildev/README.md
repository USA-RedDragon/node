# MailDev

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/maildev.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/maildev)

**MailDev** is a simple way to test your project's generated emails during development with an easy to use web interface that runs on your machine built on top of [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org).

## Install & Run

    $ npm install -g maildev
    $ maildev

If you want to use MailDev with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), you can use the ['djfarrelly/maildev' image on Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/djfarrelly/maildev/).

## Usage

    maildev [options]

      -h, --help              output usage information
      -V, --version           output the version number
      -s, --smtp [port]       SMTP port to catch emails [1025]
      -w, --web [port]        Port to run the Web GUI [1080]
      --outgoing-host <host>  SMTP host for outgoing emails
      --outgoing-port <port>  SMTP port for outgoing emails
      --outgoing-user <user>  SMTP user for outgoing emails
      --outgoing-pass <pass>  SMTP password for outgoing emails
      --outgoing-secure       Use SMTP SSL for outgoing emails
      -o, --open              Open the Web GUI after startup
      -v, --verbose

## API

MailDev can be used in your Node.js application. For more info view the 
[API docs](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/blob/master/docs/api.md).

```javascript
var MailDev = require('maildev');

var maildev = new MailDev();

maildev.on('new', function(email){
  // We got a new email!
});
```

MailDev also has a **REST API**. For more info 
[view the docs](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/blob/master/docs/rest.md).

## Outgoing email

Maildev optionally supports selectively relaying email to an outgoing SMTP server.  If you configure outgoing
email with the --outgoing-xxx options you can click "Relay" on an individual email to relay through MailDev out
to a real SMTP service that will really send the email.

  Example:

    $ maildev --outgoing-host smtp.gmail.com --outgoing-secure --outgoing-user 'you@gmail.com' --outgoing-pass '<pass>'

## Configure your project

Configure your application to send emails via port `1025` and open `localhost:1080` in your browser.

**Nodemailer (v1.0+)**

```javascript
var transport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  port: 1025,
  ignoreTLS: true,
  // other settings...
});
```

**Nodemailer (v0.7)**

```javascript
var transport = nodemailer.createTransport("SMTP", {
  port: 1025,
  // other settings...
});
```

**Django** -- Add `EMAIL_PORT = 1025` in your settings file [[source]](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-EMAIL_PORT)

**Rails** -- config settings:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
        :address => "localhost",
        :port => 1025
    }
```

## Features

* Toggle between HTML, plain text views as well as view email headers
* Test Responsive Emails w/ resizeable preview pane available for 320/480/600px screen sizes
* Ability to receive and view email attachments
* Websockets keep the interface in sync once emails are received
* Command line interface for configuring SMTP and Web interface ports
* Ability to relay email to an upstream SMTP server

## Ideas

If you're using MailDev and you have a great idea, I'd love to hear it. If you're not using MailDev because it lacks a feature, I'd love to hear that too. Add an issue to the repo [here](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/issues/new) or contact me on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/djfarrelly).

## Contributing

Any help on MailDev would be awesome. There is plenty of room for improvement. Feel free to [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/issues/new) from small to big changes. 

To run **MailDev** during development:


    # grunt-cli is needed by grunt; ignore this if already installed
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    grunt dev


The `grunt dev` task will run the project using nodemon and restart automatically when changes are detected. SASS files will be compiled automatically on save also. To trigger some emails for testing run `node test/send.js` in a separate shell. Please run jshint to your lint code before submitting a pull request; run `grunt jshint`.

To run the test suite, use [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/):

    $ npm install -g mocha
    $ mocha

## Thanks

**MailDev** is built on using great open source projects including [Express](http://expressjs.com), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and two great projects from [Andris Reinman](https://github.com/andris9): [Simple SMTP](https://github.com/andris9/simplesmtp) and [Mailparser](https://github.com/andris9/mailparser). Many thanks to Andris as his projects are the backbone of this app and to [MailCatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/) for the inspiration.
